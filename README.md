The NatureHero program is a simple quiz game that helps users learn how to sort waste. 
The program uses a HashMap to store a list of items and their corresponding correct bin colors. 
The items are shuffled randomly, and the user is prompted to enter the correct bin color for each item. 
 If the user's answer matches the correct color, their score increases by one. 
 Otherwise, the correct answer is displayed, and the user's score remains unchanged.
 At the end of the quiz, the user's score is displayed as a fraction of the total number of questions.
