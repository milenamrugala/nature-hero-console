The NatureHero program (console version) is a simple quiz game that helps users learn how to sort waste. 
The program uses bin-colors.txt file to store a list of items and their corresponding correct bin colors. 
The items are shuffled randomly, and the user is prompted to enter the correct bin color for each item. 
If the user's answer matches the correct color, their score increases by one. 
Otherwise, the correct answer is displayed, and the user's score remains unchanged.
At the end of the quiz, the user's score is displayed as a fraction of the total number of questions.
After the game ends, the player will have the option to provide feedback on the game by answering "y" or "n" to a prompt.
If the user chooses to provide feedback, they can type their feedback, which will be saved to a file called "nature-hero-feedback.txt". 
If the user chooses not to provide feedback, the game will end.
 
 
To use the program, simply run the NatureHero.java file in your preferred Java development environment.
The program will prompt you to enter the correct bin color for each item.
 
 
** This simple quiz game is one of the ideas that I collect for my main NatureHero project in Spring Boot.
