The NatureHero program (console version) is a simple quiz game that helps users learn how to sort waste. 
The program uses txt file to store a list of items and their corresponding correct bin colors. 
The items are shuffled randomly, and the user is prompted to enter the correct bin color for each item. 
If the user's answer matches the correct color, their score increases by one. 
Otherwise, the correct answer is displayed, and the user's score remains unchanged.
At the end of the quiz, the user's score is displayed as a fraction of the total number of questions.
 
 
To use the program, simply run the NatureHero.java file in your preferred Java development environment.
The program will prompt you to enter the correct bin color for each item.
 
 
** The quiz is an idea for my main NatureHero project.
